## Novel Writing Experience Ideas

- **Scene cards with status:** per-chapter scene list with length target, tone tags, and a drafting/revise/polish pill. Helps spot thin scenes and pacing gaps.
- **Character voice board:** sidebar panel pinning each POV’s diction rules, forbidden phrases, signature metaphors; small “voice check” overlay while writing in that POV.
- **Beat-to-draft sync:** outline beats sit beside the draft with “resolved in draft” checkboxes so missing beats are obvious.
- **Continuity checks:** “recent canon” strip showing last mentions of names/locations/objects with chapter numbers to avoid contradictions.
- **Mood palette:** quick presets (e.g., tense/heist, warm/reunion) that surface tone reminders in the editor header and in prompts/notes.
- **Time-in-draft indicator:** session timer per chapter with a nudge if you linger too long before moving to the next beat.
- **Term/lexicon inline:** hover cards for terminology and character names pulled from the Terminology panel, with an “insert canonical phrasing” action.
- **Draft snapshots:** one-click checkpoints per chapter with diff view for later revisions.
- **Prompt cheatsheet:** collapsible drawer with 3–5 prompts tied to the current chapter goal (stakes, emotion, sensory anchor).
- **Read-aloud + rhythm view:** playback with pacing markers (sentence length heatmap) to catch clunky spots.
