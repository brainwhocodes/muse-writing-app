# Chapter Generation Checklist

Use this checklist when creating a new chapter or continuing an existing one. Keep tone, voice, and synopsis alignment as the top priorities, then shape length based on story beats rather than a fixed word count.

## Step 1: Inputs and setup
- [x] Confirm the latest synopsis/outline and any required plot beats for this chapter.
- [x] Capture story bible anchors: POV, tense, voice, genre, and key style markers (diction, rhythm, imagery).
- [x] Set target audience age group (Adult, YA, Middle Grade, Chapter Book) before drafting.
- [x] Identify continuity constraints: timeline position, location, character states, and unresolved threads.
- [x] Define the desired chapter function (setup, escalation, reveal, setback, aftermath, pivot).
- [x] Set a flexible target length range based on scene count and beat density (avoid hard word counts).

## Step 2: Initial chapter generation
- [x] Open with a tone-consistent hook that reflects the synopsis and current stakes.
- [x] Track POV fidelity and internal voice throughout (no sudden perspective drift).
- [x] Introduce or advance beats in the intended order; avoid adding unplanned arcs.
- [x] Maintain character intent and motivation alignment with prior chapters and synopsis.
- [x] Balance exposition and action to match the established pacing.
- [x] Close with a chapter-level resolution or pressure point that matches the intended function.

## Step 3: Continuation of an existing chapter
- [x] Re-anchor with the last paragraph's emotional state, setting, and immediate objective.
- [x] Continue the same narrative cadence and sentence rhythm from the final 1-2 paragraphs.
- [x] Preserve subtext and tension already in progress; do not reset or re-explain.
- [x] Resolve or deepen the current micro-conflict before pivoting to a new beat.
- [x] Verify continuity: names, props, injuries, weather, time-of-day, and dialogue intent.

## Step 4: Tone and synopsis consistency
- [x] Check diction and metaphor style against the project voice sample.
- [x] Keep thematic emphasis consistent (e.g., hope vs. dread, wonder vs. realism).
- [x] Ensure new details support the synopsis rather than expanding scope without intent.
- [x] Avoid genre drift (e.g., humor in grim scenes, modern slang in historical tone).
- [x] Confirm emotional throughline matches the chapter's planned arc.

## Step 5: Length and pacing (no fixed word count)
- [x] Tie length to beat list: 1-2 key beats per scene, 2-4 scenes per chapter by default.
- [x] Use a soft range (min/target/max) and end when the chapter goal is achieved.
- [x] Expand or compress based on tension: slow down for high emotion, speed up for urgency.
- [x] Avoid filler: every paragraph should change stakes, reveal character, or move the plot.

## Step 6: Length rules by genre and audience
### Science fiction
- [x] 2-4 scenes; 2-3 key beats total (setup -> complication -> turn).
- [x] Soft range: 1,800-3,500 words; go longer only when world/tech detail changes stakes.
- [x] Keep exposition at ~30% max; split the chapter if it dominates.
- [x] End on a hook tied to the world or its consequences.

### General fiction
- [x] 2-3 scenes; 2-4 beats total.
- [x] Soft range: 1,500-3,000 words; stretch to 3,500 only for emotional climaxes.
- [x] Every 2-4 paragraphs should shift stakes, emotion, or information.
- [x] End with an emotional pivot or decision.

### Children's novels (chapter book / middle grade)
- [x] Chapter Book (6-9): 800-1,800 words; 1-2 beats total.
- [x] Middle Grade (8-12): 1,200-2,500 words; 1-2 beats per scene.
- [x] Keep exposition minimal (10-20%); favor action and dialogue.
- [x] Short paragraphs (1-4 sentences) and a clear hook to the next chapter.

## Step 7: Final pass before saving
- [x] Ensure the last paragraph tees up the next chapter's purpose.
- [x] Remove redundant recap that the reader would already know.
- [x] Quick continuity scan against prior chapter and synopsis.
- [x] Verify formatting and dialogue conventions are consistent with the project.
